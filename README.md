# DBSCAN_BHXRB_Classifier
The aim of this project is to automate the classification process of the Black Hole's States in a Black Hole X-ray Binary System

Aim: To categorize the states of Black Hole X-ray Binaries within synthetic data employing the unsupervised DBSCAN algorithm

This project auotomates the classification process of the Black Hole's States in a Black Hole X-ray Binary System.

The pdf file readme_Black_Hole_state_classify.pdf uploaded in this repository describes the following details:

1. The Black Hole states and their characteristics.
2. How the synthetic data is generated.
3. The algorithm used for classification.
4. The metrics for the evaluation of the model.
